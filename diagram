Architecture Explanation
User Interface:
Built using Next.js, this layer handles user interactions and displays weather data. It connects to the WebSocket server for real-time alerts and updates.
WebSocket Server:
This component manages WebSocket connections and facilitates real-time communication between clients (UI) and the server. It triggers alerts based on temperature thresholds defined by users.
Prisma Client:
An ORM that interfaces with your PostgreSQL database. It handles CRUD operations for user settings and weather data.
OpenWeatherMap API:
This external API is called to fetch the current weather data for various cities. The data is processed and stored in the database for further analysis.
How It All Works Together
Users set their weather preferences through the UI, which sends data to the server.
The server fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at scheduled intervals or on demand.
Weather data is stored in the database via Prisma. Daily summaries are generated and stored.
The server checks the temperature against user-defined thresholds. If an alert condition is met, a message is sent through the WebSocket server to notify connected clients in real time.
This architecture allows for efficient data retrieval, user interaction, and real-time notifications, creating a robust weather monitoring system.
